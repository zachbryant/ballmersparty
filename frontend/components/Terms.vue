      <ul>
        <li>
          Without implied obligation, we may remove or block Content from BP
          that violates these Terms, is unlawful, offensive, threatening,
          libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, that

          have the right to limit partially or completely the privileges of any
          BP User who engages in the above behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          You alone are responsible for Your interaction with other Users via
          BP. If You have a dispute with one or more Users or if You disagree
          with the results of a Challenge, Your sole remedy is to cease using
          BP. You irrevocably and forever release Us (and Our officers,
          directors, agents, subsidiaries, contractors, joint ventures and

          way connected with such disputes. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT,

          suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for
          termination of Your use of BP and may be referred to appropriate law
          enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other
          remedies We may have at law or in equity.
